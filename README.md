## New Version Procedure

Before making changes to the theme follow this procedure to avoid editing on the live website.

1. Login to the Shopify backend.
2. Navigate to Online Store > Themes.
3. Duplicate the current theme.
4. Publish the duplicated theme with "Copy of" in the name (e.g. "Copy of New Breed 2.2.2").
5. Rename the old, unpublished theme to the newer version number you will be working on (e.g. "New Breed 2.3.0").
6. Rename the duplicated, published theme so that it does not have "Copy of" in it but still represents the older theme version number (e.g. "New Breed 2.2.2").
7. Update the version number in `package.json` to reflect the version in development.

## Edit Procedure

Whenever changes are being made follow this procedure.

1. Start `theme watch` (or `npm run watch`).
2. Preview the changes by running `theme open` (or `npm run preview`) or by finding the new theme in the Shopify backend and selecting "Customize" on it.

```
NOTE: Some theme code changes made for 3rd party applications (from the Shopify store) will not be preview-able unless you view them by means of the "Customize" button/view.
```

3. Edit and commit changes as necessary.

## Publish Procedure

Once a new version is ready to go live refer to this procedure.

1. Add the release date, new version number, and description to the `README.md` versions section.
2. Commit with the message formatted: `Publish v<version#>`.
3. Go to the Shopify backend and navigate to Online Store > Themes.
4. Find the theme with the new version that you have been editing (e.g. "New Breed 2.3.0").
5. Publish the new theme version.
6. Verify that it has successfully published to the live site and is now the current theme.
